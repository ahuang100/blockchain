# blockchain-skeleton
Skeleton code for the Cyber x ICPC blockchain workshop

## Getting Started
There's some code missing in the skeleton, but you should be able to run it even without filling it in.

1. Using a Python package manager, install Flask.
2. Run `node.py`.
3. Make requests to the server! It will be running on localhost, Flask should tell you the port number. For making requests, you can use something like Postman.
